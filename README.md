# Airbnb Clone Project
A web application imitating the Airbnb website including both front-end and back-end components, such as:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

# Command Interpreter
To initialize it, type in the console:
- In interacive mode: `./console.py`
- In non-interactive mode: `echo (COMMAND) | ./console.py`

# How to use it
With the established commands (create, update, destroy, etc), you can use them to manipulate data.
`(hbnb) {command goes here}`

## Console examples
Example 1  
`$ ./console.py`  
`(hbnb) quit`  
`$`
  
Example 2  
`$ ./console.py`  
`(hbnb) help`  
  
`Documented commands (type help <topic>):`
